<p>Originally made in February of 2023 for the UNO IT Innovation Cup - the old repository was on a friend's deleted account</p>


### Overview
  Pi Solart Grid Checker, or PiSGC, is an environmental simulation of the different effects on a grid of solar panels. This project utilizes Raspberry Pi Pico W and Epaper 2.13 display to show a graph of the simulated hourly energy output in a day, along with the  environmental factors that effect that output beside the graph. This was made for the 2023 UNO IT Innovation Cup.
